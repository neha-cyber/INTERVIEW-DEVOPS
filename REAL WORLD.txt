üîß Jenkins / CI-CD Scenarios
How will you set up a Jenkins job to build and deploy a Dockerized React app?

Explain pipeline creation, cloning Git repo, building Docker image, and running container.

What if your Jenkins build fails after pulling the latest code? How will you debug?

Talk about checking Jenkins logs, Git commit issues, and Dockerfile errors.

How do you trigger a Jenkins build on every GitHub push?

Via GitHub webhook integration and Jenkins "Poll SCM" or "GitHub hook trigger".

What if the Jenkins job works manually but not via webhook?

Possible causes: Webhook misconfig, Jenkins-GitHub credential issue, or firewall block.

üê≥ Docker Scenarios
You pushed a new Docker image and deployment failed‚Äîwhat would you check?

Dockerfile syntax, port mapping, exposed env vars, app logs (docker logs).

How do you update an environment variable without changing the Dockerfile?

Use docker run -e VAR=value or use docker-compose.

What if the Docker container exits immediately after running?

Check for CMD issues in Dockerfile or missing entrypoint scripts.

‚òÅÔ∏è AWS / S3 / DevOps Scenarios
You have app logs in S3. How do you analyze or alert on errors in real-time?

Use AWS Lambda + CloudWatch + S3 event trigger + SNS or Datadog for alerts.

A deployment failed because an S3 file was missing‚Äîhow do you debug?

Check bucket policy, region mismatch, file path or IAM permissions.

How would you host a React app on S3?

Build React app ‚Üí Upload build/ folder to S3 ‚Üí Enable static website hosting ‚Üí Set bucket policy.

üîç Git / Version Control Scenarios
You accidentally pushed sensitive data‚Äîhow will you remove it?

Use git filter-branch or BFG tool, then force push with proper .gitignore.

Your feature branch has many commits; how do you clean it before merging?

Use git rebase -i and squash commits.

üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting & Real Incidents
What‚Äôs your approach when a production server goes down?

Immediate steps, log checking, rollback if needed, communicate with teams.

How would you troubleshoot high CPU usage in a containerized app?

Use docker stats, top command inside container, and logs.

A developer says their code is not reflecting after deployment‚Äîwhat will you check?

Check build logs, deployment steps, cached layers, and tag mismatch.

Would you like sample answers for these scenarios too?
